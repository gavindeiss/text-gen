My biggest hobbies are music, video games and reading. I play the guitar, drums, and saxophone. Recently I've started trying to learn the piano. I listen to most genres. I used to listen to a lot of rap but recently it's given way to more electronic and R&B.

I play a good amount of multiplayer video games. I don't consider myself too competitive of a person, but I do like being able to see myself progress and grow a skill while getting a cheap dopamine rush when I win. The game I play the most of is Smite, which has a lot of mythological characters that I appreciate. I loved mythology as a kid, especially the Greek ones since those are the ones most widely taught growing up for kids in America.

I play plenty of single player games too. Hades is one I'm going through right now, another mythological-inspired game. While there are plenty of mindless games out there (that I play too much of), I don't think video games get enough credit as an art form, because there's plenty that fit the bill. The fact that they blend art, music, storytelling, all with the technical aspect of coding it all up, implementing physics, and making it an actual balanced game that's fun should get more appreciation.

In terms of reading, I stick to mainly fantasy and more recently science-fiction. I like Dune on the sci-fi side above all else. I also recently read the book that inspired Blade Runner, "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep," which is a much less catchy title and one that I'm curious will lead to some weird results when I run this text generator. For fantasy, I've read all the game of thrones books, and when I was growing up loved Harry Potter and Percy Jackson.

One of the things I value most is education. Both of my parents are lifelong educators.
